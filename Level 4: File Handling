Level 4: File Handling

19. Read a file and count the number of lines in it:
```python
filename = input("Enter the filename: ")
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    line_count = len(lines)
print("Number of lines in the file:", line_count)
```

20. Read a file and find the longest word in it:
```python
filename = input("Enter the filename: ")
with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    words = file.read().split()
    longest_word = max(words, key=len)
print("The longest word in the file is:", longest_word)
```

21. Write a list of numbers to a file:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
filename = input("Enter the filename: ")
with open(filename, 'w') as file:
    for num in numbers:
        file.write(str(num) + '\n')
print("Numbers have been written to the file.")
```
